With the advancement of high-speed magnetic levitation trains, electromagnetic levitation control technology is gaining increasing attention. In this project, we develop a high-precision four-point magnetic levitation platform based on a T-shaped structure. By employing a nonlinear model of electromagnets, we implement active disturbance rejection control to identify various disturbances. Additionally, real-time compensation through an extended state observer effectively addresses electromagnetic coupling and load variations, ultimately achieving robust stability control for the platform.
