In this paper, an Euler-Lagrange-model based torque assignment (ELM-TA) control scheme is proposed for a distributed drive (DD) system with multiple in-wheel motors. It focuses on the torque assignment of the multiple motors in DD system, in order to achieve optimal dynamic performance, synchronization, and reliability. Considering the flexible coupling effects, an Euler-Lagrange model is formulated for 1/2 DD system with dual in-wheel permanent magnet (DIW-PM) motors. As a consequence of the nonlinear characteristic of the drive system with DIW-PM motors, direct torque control with multi-voltage vector integrated modulation is implemented with the objective of enhancing the reliability and robustness of the drive system. In addition, the Euler-Lagrange-model based controller is designed for the motor control unit, where the dynamic tuning strategy of interconnection and friction damping coefficients is developed to achieve dynamic decoupling of state variables. Finally, the experimental setups are constructed by considering the different drive modes. The experimental results verify the validity and reliability of the proposed approach, which shows a good potential candidate for distributed electric vehicle drive system.
