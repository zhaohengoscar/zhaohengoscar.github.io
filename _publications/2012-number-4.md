To improve the coordination and modulation of multiple in-wheel motors in electric vehicles (EVs), this invention presents an integrated modulation drive system and its control method for multi-in-wheel motor electric vehicles. The drive system consists of a vehicle control unit (VCU), two structurally identical integrated drivers, and a multi-mode arbitrator. Each integrated driver includes an integrated modulation controller and a six-half-bridge inverter, connected in series. The output terminals of the six-half-bridge inverter in each integrated driver are connected to the two in-wheel motors on the corresponding side of the vehicle. Based on torque control, the system treats the two in-wheel motors on the same side of the distributed drive electric vehicle (EV) as a unified entity. Through the use of two integrated drivers, the proposed method achieves direct coordinated control of all four in-wheel motors, thereby constructing a comprehensive spatial voltage vector diagram. This approach effectively consolidates the two originally independent in-wheel motors into a unified system, which reduces the computational burden on the upper-level vehicle control unit while optimizing vehicle efficiency and energy economy. By refining control strategies, the proposed system enhances the overall maneuverability and dynamic performance of EVs across various driving conditions.
