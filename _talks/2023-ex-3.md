Backgroundï¼š
---
The coordination strategy of existing distributed drive systems primarily emphasizes torque allocation by upper-level controllers, often neglecting the performance indicators of each in-wheel motor and the coordination among motor controllers. Furthermore, the redundancy of multi-motor controllers and multi-actuators in distributed drive systems results in low fault tolerance for signal transmission.
