Reviewed Research on Information Security in Smart Medical Systems. Research and studied robotics automation, which provides a foundation for my future research. 

This project has significantly inspired my subsequent research on the coordinated control of multiple in-wheel motors. In my later studies, I drew an analogy between the cooperative control of electric vehicle motors and the coordinated motion of robotic arms, which led to the development of a novel research approach.
